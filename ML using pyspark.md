The ML using pyspark notebook used the popular housing dataset and basic Linear Regression ML model to predict house price based on multiple factors. 
The purpose of the project is to show the effectiveness of using Pyspark for ML. In particular, Spark mllib has built-in libaries that can transform categorical data into numbers, and tranform feature and label variables into vectors and scale them before fitting in  the model.
